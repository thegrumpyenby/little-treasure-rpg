# Little Treasure RPG meets Taskmaster?

Hi! This is a smol text-based RPG I created as part of AppBrewery’s Python Bootcamp on Udemy. This was the Day 3 project, used to practice nested if-statements.

I had quite a bit of fun doing it and noticed halfway through that the voice of the narrator sounded awfully familiar. See, my partner and I have been watching the British TV show Taskmaster later. Like, a lot. Like, all of it. And we’ve been watching nothing else. I guess that’s how Greg’s (the Taskmaster) voice snuck into the narrated bits of my RPG.

Some people online found that amusing, so I thought I’d share the game. I haven’t honed the voice once I realised what I was doing, because right now I need to focus on the rest of the coding course instead of futzing with a silly RPG, but I might come back later on to fix that. Especially since I might come back later anyway to refactor my code and add some things.

So for now, I hope you enjoy this silly little thing that I built. I surely enjoyed making it last night and don’t even regret that it meant I cooked dinner a little late. 

Cheers,
Kai
